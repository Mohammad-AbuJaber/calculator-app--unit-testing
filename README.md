# String Calculator

## Introduction

This project implements a simple string calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. The implementation follows
the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) and utilizes test-driven development (TDD) to ensure accuracy and robustness.

## Functionality

### 1. Create a simple calculator function

The `calc` function is responsible for performing arithmetic operations on given numbers and operators.

### 2. Handle basic arithmetic operations

The `calc` function should accurately handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 3. Error Handling

The `calc` function should appropriately handle error cases such as division by zero, invalid operators, invalid input
types, and insufficient number of arguments.

### 4. Additional Functionality

- Allow the `calc` function to handle an unknown amount of numbers.
- Ignore numbers larger than 1000 during calculations.

## Instructions

1. **Commits and Steps**
    - Perform each step as its own commit to maintain a clear and organized development history.
    - Adhere to the AAA pattern and follow test-driven development.

2. **Testing**
    - Write comprehensive test cases to achieve 100% test coverage.
    - Ensure that each test case verifies the correct functionality of the `calc` function.

## Usage

To use the calculator, follow these steps:

1- Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohammad-AbuJaber/calculator-app--unit-testing.git
```

2- Go to the project directory.

```bash
cd calculator-app--unit-testing
```

3- Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

4- Run the test.

You can run the test using an IDE like Webstorm or Vscode, or you can run it using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
